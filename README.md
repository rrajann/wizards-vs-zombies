# My Personal Project

## A Single-Panel Game Survival Game

### What will the application do?
This application is a Zelda inspired survival-type game where the player is placed in a single panel setting, 
and you must destroy incoming enemies. Enemies are basic—only approach you and can damage you upon contact.
The player has a health bar, and everytime the enemy contacts the player, the player's health bar decreases.
Game is over when player’s health bar is at zero.

The player is a wizard who can move in 2-dimensions (in all four directions). The player can also throw blasts to 
damage incoming zombies.

### Who will use it?
As described, this application is a game, thus will be played by anyone that is interested in retro-style games
with a survival component.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
Although I have not been programming for long, everytime I think of a project to do, my mind always gravitates towards 
designing a game. For example, during CPSC 110 I would program games in my spare time and in the summer I programmed 
snake in JS + HTML + CSS. I want to challenge myself by making a game I would personally enjoy, thus why my game has 
many interactive components.
